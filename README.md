# NFT Mint Runner

Local browser-based tool for public SeaDrop NFT mints.

It runs on your own machine, reads public mint configuration on-chain, prepares signed transactions locally, and broadcasts them through selected RPC endpoints. It is not a hosted service.

## Main Advantage

Prepare and sign transactions before the public mint starts.  
When the timer starts, NFT Mint Runner automatically sends the pre-signed transactions through your selected RPC endpoints and executes the mint.

## Features

- Browser UI, no terminal wizard.
- Ethereum Mainnet, Base, and Robinhood Chain.
- NFT contract address and compatible OpenSea URLs.
- On-chain SeaDrop public mint inspection.
- Multiple local wallets.
- Multiple RPC endpoints with wrong-chain detection.
- Quantity, gas, and balance validation.
- Pre-signed transactions before mint start.
- Concurrent broadcast and per-wallet result tracking.
- English and Turkish UI toggle.

## Security Warning

Private keys stay only in the local Node process memory. They are not saved to disk, `.env`, browser storage, URLs, logs, or API responses.

Use fresh mint wallets with limited balances. Never paste a main wallet key.
